<addresses>
  <address name="composite-topic">
    <anycast>
      <queue name="queue1"/>
    </anycast>
  </address>

  <address name="topic1">
    <multicast/>
  </address>
  
  <divert name="divert1">
    <address>topic1</address>
    <forwarding-address>composite-topic</forwarding-address>
    <exclusive>false</exclusive>
  </divert>

  <address name="topic2">
    <multicast/>
  </address>

  <divert name="divert2">
    <address>topic2</address>
    <forwarding-address>composite-topic</forwarding-address>
    <exclusive>false</exclusive>
  </divert>
</addresses>


Explanation:
Addresses: topic1 and topic2 are configured as multicast addresses. They do not have their own queues here but will forward their messages to another address.
Diverts: Messages from both topic1 and topic2 are diverted to the composite-topic address.
Queue: composite-topic has an anycast queue (queue1), which means it operates like a standard queue. This queue will receive messages from both topic1 and topic2 through the diverts.
This configuration ensures that messages published to either topic1 or topic2 are forwarded to a single queue (queue1) under the composite-topic address, allowing you to subscribe effectively to multiple topics through one queue.


This method involves setting up diverts that will route messages from multiple addresses to a single, centralized queue. Here's a basic idea:

Define a single queue under a new address, e.g., composite-topic.
Use diverts to forward messages from topic1 and topic2 to composite-topic.
